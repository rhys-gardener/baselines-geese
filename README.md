https://www.kaggle.com/c/hungry-geese



Create environment from requirements.txt before running. 

Run training by running:

python train_baselines.py

Should send tensorboard logs to ppo_geese_tensorboard. 

Model can be submitted to kaggle using the files in the submission folder (copy the best model to this dir)

To do: 
- Sort out folder structure
- Logging to log file
- Setup config file for experiments 
- More tidy up
